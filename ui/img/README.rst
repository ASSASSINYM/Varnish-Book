Table https://github.com/varnish/Varnish-Book/blob/master/ui/img/screenshots.csv
lists the files that have to be updated everytime there are meaningful changes
in the GUIs they show.  The image size or aspect ratio of the replacing image
does not need to be exact.  If you change the aspect ratio, please compile the
book to see how it is rendered in PDF and HTML exports.
