Counter;Description 
``MAIN.threads_limited``;Counts how many times ``varnishd`` hits the maximum allowed number of threads. The maximum number of Varnish threads is given by the parameter ``thread_pool_max``. Issue the command ``varnishadm param.show thread_pool_max`` to see this parameter. 
``MAIN.threads_failed``;Increases every time ``pthread_create()`` fails. You can avoid this situation by tuning the maximum number of processes available with the ``ulimit -u`` command. You may also look at the ``thread-max`` Linux parameter in ``/proc/sys/kernel/threads-max``. 
``MAIN.thread_queue_len`` ;Shows the current number of sessions waiting for a thread. This counter is first introduced in Varnish 4. 
``MAIN.sess_queued``;Contains the number of sessions that are queued because there are no available threads immediately. Consider to increase the ``thread_pool_min`` parameter. 
``MAIN.sess_dropped``;Counts how many times sessions are dropped because ``varnishd`` hits the maximum thread queue length. You may consider to increase the ``thread_queue_limit`` Varnish parameter as a solution to drop less sessions. 
``MAIN.n_lru_nuked``;Number of least recently used (LRU) objects thrown out to make room for new objects. If this is zero, there is no reason to enlarge your cache. Otherwise, your cache is evicting objects due to space constraints. In this case, consider to increase the size of your cache.
``MAIN.n_object``;Number of cached objects
``MAIN.client_req``;Number of client requests
``MAIN.losthdr``;Counts HTTP header overflows produced either by client or server
